<P>
Life is important for everyone, especially when you have a family to feed, a company to run or even a dog to walk. 
In each case, it is important to have good health or some instruments that will manage to maintain your health updated all the time. 
People who have an unhealthy lifestyle or are aware that they may inherit cardiovascular or respiratory problems as well as people 
who are affected by the Covid-19, but stay at home in auto isolation may want to have in their first aid kit a tool such as a pulse oximeter.

What is a pulse oximeter?
</h2>
</P>
<P>
Pulse oximetry is a quick and completely painless test. His goal is to measure how much oxygen your red blood cells are
carrying and this value is indicated by SpO2 – the saturation of peripheral oxygen which is an estimate of the SaO2 – the saturations of arterial oxygen.
  It is highly important to have a precise balance of oxygen-saturated blood for a normal physical life. 
Healthy people will get an oxygen reading of about 95 to 98 percent. People who might have a health condition end up with an oxygen percent that 
is lower than 93 percent, this condition is called hypoxia – lack of oxygen perfusing the tissues. In this case, it is recommended to have an appointment with your doctor.

<h2>
How does a pulse oximeter work?
</h2>
</P>

<P>
The oximeter works on the principle of how much light your blood can absorb, this tells the technology how much oxygen your blood contains. 
The device has light-emitting diodes, which shine two types of red light through the tissue. The sensor on the other side of the tissue picks
 up the light that is transferred through the tissues. These wavelengths of light are targeting hemoglobin, a protein molecule in your blood
 that carries 4 oxygen molecules. Hemoglobin absorbs different amounts and wavelengths of light depending on the level of oxygen it’s carrying,
 for instance, if the blood contains a lot of oxygen hemoglobin will absorb more infrared light and let more red light pass through it. 
And vice versa, if blood doesn’t have enough oxygen it absorbs more red light and lets more infrared light pass through it. 
The oximeter can determine which of the hemoglobin is in pulsatile blood and can then determine the SpO2 of arterial blood in the peripheral circulation.
<P>Take into consideration that the device works better with warmer hands than cold hands. And a fluctuation of oxygen level can occur, in this case, 
consider taking measurements a few times a day. Furthermore, try it in different positions, such as while lying flat on your back or while walking.

Can a pulse oximeter help you detect an early case of COVID-19?
</h2></P>
<P>
COVID-19 has been considered the disease of the 21st century, which affected more than half of the population on this planet and killed a considerable amount of people.
 As the pandemic is not over and we are still exposed to this risk it is primordial to be aware of the concentration of oxygen flowing in your blood each day. 
If a person has a mild case of COVID-19 and is self-treating at home, an oximeter can be a helpful tool for checking oxygen levels so that low oxygen 
levels can be caught early. As a good rule of thumb, a person with COVID-19 monitoring his or her clinical status will want to ensure that the SpO2 
reading stays consistently at or above 90 to 92%. If the number consistently drops below this threshold, timely medical evaluation is warranted.
